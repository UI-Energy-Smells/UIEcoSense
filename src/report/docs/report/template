# UIEcoSense Analysis Report

## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to present the results of a code analysis performed on the given directory. The analysis was conducted in order to identify smells in the code and to generate a report that provides useful information for improving the quality of the code.


## Code Analysis
Here are the list of smells that were considered:

- **Inline Style**
  > Use CSS to control layout, and styling instead of using JavaScript

- **Lazy Loading**
  > Reduce the energy needed to load non-critical content that is not immediately necessary

- **Anonymous Event Handler**
  > Use named functions instead of anonymous functions for event handlers
  > Anonymous functions are not reusable and can cause performance issues

- **Load Script Async**
  > Load scripts asynchronously to prevent blocking the page load

- **Client Side Logging**
  > Avoid using console.log() and other client side logging methods in production code

- **UnOptimized Images**
  > Optimize and compress images and graphics to reduce file size, lower data transfer and improve load time


- **UnSafe Fonts**
  > Use web-safe font formats such as WOFF2 and WOFF for faster load time and less data usage
